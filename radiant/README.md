# Radiant
Radiant is a Domain Specific Language [DSL] for monitoring and activity detection from sensor event data in IoT systems. This extension provides the complete set of tooling around the DSL including LSP, code generation and direct deployment to a Siddhi runner.

## Commands

### Generate
Generate the currently focused file via the command palette.

- Only available in `.rad` files
- Expects a `radiant.yaml` in the same directory

### Deploy
Generate and deploy the currently focused file via the command palette.

- Only available in `.rad` files
- Expects a `radiant.yaml` in the same directory

## Settings

### Generate on File Save
The extension has built in support for generation on file save. Given that the current file is a `.rad` file, the generation is triggered on file save. A `radiant.yaml` is expected to exist in the same directory as the `.rad` file. The output will be written into the default output directory. 

This setting is **enabled by default** but can be configured via the extension settings (see [Configuring extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_configuring-extensions)).

```json
# settings.json
{
  "radiant.generateOnSave": true,
}
```
